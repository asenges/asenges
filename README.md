🔧 **About Me**

Versatile and results-driven Software Developer with 20+ years of hands-on experience delivering high-impact engineering and quality assurance solutions across Linux and Windows environments. Specialized in API testing, system analysis, and programming, with strong proficiency in DevOps methodologies.

Currently expanding my expertise in systems programming, with a growing interest in **Rust** (currently learning), **C**, and other low-level technologies. I enjoy building tools that help others work better — whether it's through automation, performance profiling, or system-level debugging.

Always open to collaboration in cross-functional teams and projects where innovation and efficiency meet.
